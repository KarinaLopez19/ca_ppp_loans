# ca_ppp_loans

In March 2020, the US congress passed the CARES Act. Part of this legislation included the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), whose mission was to sustain small businesses and allow them to remain open in a post-COVID economy. In order to better assess the performance of our federal government in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, **we analyzed the PPP loan distribution to assess if the loans were, in fact, targeted to those populations most heavily impacted by the pandemic.** Our report informs the extent to which government intervention was being properly administered during this public health crisis. **We yielded measurable objectives that federal and state legislation can strive to meet when distributing future aid relief.**

**Our final deliverables include:**
- A comprehensive visual guide of our findings
- A detailed report
